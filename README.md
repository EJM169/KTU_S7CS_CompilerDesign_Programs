# KTU_S7CS_CompilerDesign_Programs
This are the programs that I did in my 7th Semester compiler design lab.
This programs were done with aim of understanding and to implement the different phases of a compiler, t implement and test simple optimization techniques and to give exposure to compiler writing tools. 
This programs were done in the following Languages: C, Lex and Yacc
If you want to run the programs make sure you have all the languages and necessary tools to run it already installed.
